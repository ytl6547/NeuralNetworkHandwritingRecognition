1.What is the neural network trying to do in its layers. How do t-SNE plots help us understand this?
Neural network is trying to move the data that belong to the same cluster closer. t-SNE helps us understand this by illustrating high-dimension data with 2d data.


2.What effect does momentum have on the convergence of training and why? 
Momentum speeds up the convergence of training. Because gradient descent with momentum tends to keep traveling in the same direction, preventing oscillations, and decreases the loss more rapidly.


3.What would have been a good time(epoch) to stop the training and why?
Epoch 8 is a good time to stop for this assignment. After epoch 8, both the accuracy and the loss do not have significant improvement or are not getting better at all.
